# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables seamless integration of BeyondPresence avatar video streaming into a web browser using the LiveKit JS Client SDK. The integration will allow users to create BeyondPresence sessions with avatars and stream the resulting video content directly into HTML video elements in the browser. This creates a foundation for real-time avatar-based communication and interactive experiences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize a BeyondPresence session with an avatar, so that I can prepare avatar video content for streaming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the BeyondPresence SDK client with proper API credentials
2. WHEN creating a session THEN the system SHALL accept an avatar_id parameter to specify which avatar to use
3. WHEN creating a session THEN the system SHALL accept LiveKit connection parameters (token and URL)
4. WHEN session creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return a valid session object with session ID
5. IF session creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging to the developer

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a LiveKit room connection, so that I can receive the BeyondPresence video stream.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to LiveKit THEN the system SHALL use the provided LiveKit URL and token from the BeyondPresence session
2. WHEN connection is established THEN the system SHALL set up event listeners for track subscription events
3. WHEN connection is established THEN the system SHALL configure the room with adaptive streaming and dynacast optimization
4. IF connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information including connection state
5. WHEN disconnected THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and notify the application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically receive and display BeyondPresence video tracks, so that avatar video appears in my web application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video track is subscribed THEN the system SHALL automatically attach it to an HTML video element
2. WHEN a video track is subscribed THEN the system SHALL ensure the video element is properly configured for playback
3. WHEN multiple video tracks are available THEN the system SHALL handle each track independently
4. WHEN a video track is unsubscribed THEN the system SHALL detach it from all HTML elements
5. WHEN video quality changes THEN the system SHALL adapt automatically using LiveKit's adaptive streaming

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle audio from BeyondPresence streams, so that avatar interactions include both video and audio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audio track is subscribed THEN the system SHALL automatically attach it to an HTML audio element
2. WHEN audio playback is restricted by browser THEN the system SHALL detect the restriction and provide user interaction prompts
3. WHEN user interaction is required THEN the system SHALL provide a method to start audio playback
4. WHEN audio tracks are unsubscribed THEN the system SHALL properly detach and clean up audio elements
5. IF audio fails to play THEN the system SHALL provide fallback handling and error reporting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and connection management, so that the integration is robust and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error codes and messages
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
3. WHEN BeyondPresence session expires THEN the system SHALL detect expiration and provide session refresh capabilities
4. WHEN LiveKit connection drops THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and attempt reconnection
5. WHEN browser compatibility issues arise THEN the system SHALL detect unsupported features and provide graceful degradation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple API interface, so that I can integrate BeyondPresence streaming with minimal code complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the integration THEN the system SHALL provide a single configuration object for all required parameters
2. WHEN starting a stream THEN the system SHALL provide a simple method that handles both BeyondPresence session creation and LiveKit connection
3. WHEN managing video elements THEN the system SHALL provide helper methods for attaching streams to DOM elements
4. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL provide a single method to disconnect and clean up all resources
5. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide configurable logging levels for troubleshooting
